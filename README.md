===============

**Note: This repository is a work-in-progress and does not yet contain everything needed to function**

**Git history may be rewritten or lost until everything is cleaned up and stable**

*Please be patient* :)

G35 USB interfaces with strands of LED lights to control them in various flashy or useful ways according to music, time of day, and multiple types of animations.  Currently supports an [Arduino-based LED controller firmware](https://github.com/digitalcircuit/G35Arduino_Controller), but support can be easily added for other controllers.
