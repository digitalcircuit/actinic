Things left to get this repository ready
===============

## G35 USB

* Add supporting development tools (*push to netbook script, etc*)
* Clean up style and formatting (*old code, inconsistencies, and other issues*)
* Stabilize repository and avoid making history-breaking changes
* Add sample image animations and music light-shows
* Update README.md with full instructions (*building, modifying, hardware references, etc*)
* Directly use Impulse FFT library rather than calling an external program
